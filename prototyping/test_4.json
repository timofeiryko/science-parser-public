It will evaluate the clinical efficacy of guselkumab in the reduction of signs and symptoms and the safety profile of guselkumab in the treatment of PsA. The study will consists of 4 phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a blinded treatment phase of approximately 1 year (that is, 52 weeks), including a placebo controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and double-blind active treatment period from Week 24 to Week 52, and a safety follow-up phase of 8 weeks after Week 52 (Week 52 to 60) and will be 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent (at Week 48) to the final safety follow-up visit. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker evaluations will be performed in the study at defined schedule."},

A total FACIT-Fatigue subscale score was calculated as the sum of the 13 item scores (reserved scores [4 - score]) and ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue.

Tenderness on examination was recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 16 sites for an overall score range of 0-16. Higher scores indicate more severe enthesitis.
